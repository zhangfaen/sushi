# Guard: a tool call still parses at long context, where the sliding-window
# block trim and speculative verify interact.
#
# The trim changed what every sliding layer READS on any block-wide forward —
# spec verify and prefill chunks — and spec verify is exactly where a tool call
# is being detected. Both are guarded for SPEED and for byte-identity on prose;
# neither guarded a TOOL CALL at the context lengths where the trim actually
# engages (below ~8k there is nothing to trim, so short tool tests pass for the
# wrong reason).
#
# Per rung: a long filler prompt puts the request past the trim threshold, then
# the model is asked for one concrete tool call. Assertions are correctness, not
# speed: the call FIRES, its name is the declared one, its arguments are valid
# JSON carrying the value the prompt planted, and no tool markup leaks into
# visible content. The engagement line is checked too — a rung that silently
# fell back to short-context handling proves nothing.
#
# Usage: LONGCTX_TEST_MODEL=<dir> ./tests/test_tools_long_context.sh [port]
#   LONGCTX_RUNGS=16000,32000,64000   — override the token rungs
