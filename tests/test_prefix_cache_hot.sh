# test_prefix_cache_hot.sh — plan 03 phase 1 hot prefix cache validation.
#
# Two parallel conversations against the same server, each with a long shared
# system-prompt prefix. With --prefix-cache-entries 0 the hot cache is fully
# disabled, so alternating between conversations evicts the other's KV after
# every turn and every request pays full prefill. With --prefix-cache-entries
# 2, both conversations should keep their prefix hot across the alternation.
#
# Acceptance: alternating-mode 2nd-turn prefill TPS for conversation A is
# ≥ 2× faster with hot cache than without (since with the cache disabled, the
# 2nd-turn A request pays cold prefill on a long prompt).
#
# Note: --prefix-cache-entries 1 (the default) is NOT the "no hot cache" path
# any more — it's a 1-entry hot cache. The disable knob is 0. Earlier versions
# of this test treated 1 as disabled, which silently broke once the hot cache
# became the default.
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_prefix_cache_hot.sh [model_dir] [port]
