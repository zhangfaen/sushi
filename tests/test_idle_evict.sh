# --idle-evict-secs: a model nobody is using leaves residency, and the next
# request cold-loads it back.
#
# The reload this makes routine is also what the test is for. Two readers
# touch an entry's RETAINED CPU state (config, chat template) without holding a
# refcount — /v1/models and the pre-load text-gen gate on a chat request — and
# a reload frees that state. So each cycle fires both concurrently with the
# reload. Residency is read back as the `loaded` rows of /v1/models: "unloaded"
# with the memory still held is the failure this flag exists to prevent, so
# the RSS arm below backs that read.
