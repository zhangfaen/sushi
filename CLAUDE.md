# Sushi — project context for AI

A native Zig inference engine for Apple Silicon serving exactly two models: Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (`qwen4_exp`, EXL3
routed experts resident; the bf16 checkpoint can SSD-stream) and MiMo-V2.6-Flash (`mimo_v2`, experimental, text-only,
MCG EXL3 or streamed MXFP4; public from v1.1). OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible HTTP, no Python at serve time. Fork of ddalcu's mlx-serve.

- **sushi** is this engine's new name (runtime, to be opened to the public): a scripted rename changes the binary
  name, the env prefix and the home dir everywhere; until it lands, write today's names. Treat every change as future
  public code (license, NOTICE, docs); sushi is not scoped to EXL3 or to these two models forever.
- **sashimi** is the PRIVATE quant-creation stack (its own private repo): every converter, allocator, imatrix driver
  and repacker. This repo keeps only the CONSUMER contract — `docs/pack-format.md`, the Zig shard-stamp check, the
  committed `src/fixtures/`, and `sushi kld`. The oracle fixture dumpers (`tests/dump_*_fixtures.py`) stay: they
  verify the engine, they do not make packs. Converter knowledge (recipes, calibration data, research notes) never
  goes into a committed file: it goes to `docs/private/`, and committed files say only that it lives in the private
  repo.
- Everything else in `src/` (other architectures' forwards and loaders in `transformer.zig`/`model.zig`, the dormant
  ANE driver) is INHERITED upstream code: it builds, it is unreachable, and no doc covers it. The loader refuses any
  other `model_type` by name (`model.served_model_types`, `ArchitectureUnsupported` → 503); an unsupported file
  format is refused by name (`ModelFormatUnsupported` → 503; `--model` exits).

**Private, local-only** (`docs/private/`, gitignored): they exist only in the main checkout, so a git worktree does
not contain them; a worker in a worktree reads them from the main checkout's `docs/private/`. Never link to or
quote them from a committed file.

| doc | what it holds |

| `docs/private/hf-upload.md` | publishing a pack to Hugging Face: staging script, card, upload, verification, past hiccups |

Skills: `/release` (SemVer, CHANGELOG), `/bench` (llmprobe methodology, comparison traps).

## Stack

Zig 0.17 (pinned nightly via `scripts/fetch-zig.sh`; brew 0.16 no longer builds); mlx + mlx-c PINNED SUBMODULES
(`lib/mlx-src` d73eb752, `lib/mlxc-src` 56b2d39: mlx-serve's pins) self-built NAX-enabled by `scripts/build-mlx.sh` into `lib/mlx/`
(FFI `src/mlx.zig`); jinja.cpp (wangzhaode, Apache-2.0) as `lib/jinja_cpp/libjinja.a`; safetensors; BPE; `stb_image`
+ libwebp decode image INPUT. Min macOS 26.2; NAX kernels need the 26.2 deployment target (asserted by
`tests/test_mlx_staged_nax.sh`). The served binary's only non-system dylibs are `libmlxc` and Homebrew's `libwebp`
(`tests/test_serving_deps.sh`). Box: M5 Max 128 GB, macOS 27.

lists the rest.

## Building

- First-time: `./scripts/fetch-zig.sh` stages the pinned Zig (`0.17.0-dev.2248`) at `.zig-toolchain/`; ziglang.org
  drops old nightlies, so a 404 means bump the pin. A git worktree lacks `.zig-toolchain/` and `lib/mlx/`: symlink
  both from the main checkout (fetch-zig replaces a stale link with its own copy). After a toolchain/SDK change
  `rm -rf .zig-cache` (configure-time output is cached).
- **ALWAYS `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`, never bare `zig build`** (Debug is 2–4× slower ⇒ fake regressions).
  `zig build test` does NOT refresh `zig-out/bin/sushi` — rebuild before any live A/B.
- mlx + mlx-c: `scripts/build-mlx.sh`. Bump = checkout tag → rerun → re-diff `src/mlx.zig` externs against
  `lib/mlxc-src/mlx/c/*.h`.
- Jinja after `lib/jinja_cpp/*.cpp` changes: compile the 7 `.cpp` (`clang++ -std=c++17 -O2 -DNDEBUG -I .`) into
  `obj/`, `ar rcs libjinja.a obj/*.o`.

## Testing — TDD is mandatory

Order: (1) failing test FIRST, for the right reason; (2) minimum code to green; (3) full suite (`zig build test
-Doptimize=ReleaseFast` 0 fail + relevant `tests/*.sh`); (4) refactor. A live curl is a sanity check, NOT a test.

Feature = unit test that fails without it (+ integration script if HTTP-observable). Bug fix = regression test
red→fix→green. Refactor = characterization test first. A live failure revealing a CLASS ships the instance test plus a
corpus entry or invariant in `src/format_corpus_test.zig` plus a rule in the matching doc.

Hermetic suites: `zig build test -Dtest-filter="format corpus"`, `-Dtest-filter="tool traffic"`. Live:
`tests/test_qwen4_exp.sh`, `tests/test_bf16_streaming.sh`, `tests/test_mtp_equivalence.sh`,
`tests/test_prefix_cache_*.sh`, `tests/test_smoke_matrix.sh`. Matrix: `tests/CLAUDE.md`.

- **A test never writes to stdout** (stderr only): under `zig build test` fd 1 is the build runner's protocol pipe;
  one stray line hangs the runner while the standalone binary passes.
- **A PASSING test prints NOTHING, on either stream**: the pinned nightly renders any test stderr through its failure
  renderer (`failed command: … --listen=-`, exit 0), which reads as a failed suite. Diagnostics ride an env switch
  (`SUSHI_EXL3_LAYER_UBENCH`). Guard: `tests/test_test_runner_quiet.sh`.
- **No source-scan tests** (`@embedFile` + "this string appears in that function"): they pin text, not behaviour.
  Test the behaviour or state the rule in a comment.
- **An integration assertion that a MODEL must think/answer/call is a checkpoint expectation**: assert the INVARIANT,
  branch on the model's choice.
- `zig build test` sometimes reports `failed command` on a FIRST run and is green on a direct re-run (Metal
  contention between parallel test binaries, benign, unpinned).

## Releases & benchmarking

`/release` for process, SemVer, CHANGELOG. Perf gate = `./tests/bench.sh` on the FINAL tree vs the previous column in
`benchmarks.md` (ONE new column per release). `/bench` for methodology: same-methodology cells only, spec cells are
variance (sample across boots), an A/B arm is proven by ENGAGEMENT lines in its log. Interleave A/B kernels in ONE
process (separate runs drift 15%); same-boot medians per cell; sub-2% calls need an IDLE box.

Release notes thank every outside contributor by @handle for each merged PR the release ships (`gh pr list --state
merged` since the last tag); a credit missed in a shipped release goes into the next one, marked as belated.

A pack reaches Hugging Face only as the staged, checked copy that `docs/private/hf-upload.md` describes, with an
owner-approved card; the README pack line follows once the repo is live.

## Conventions

- Minimal DRY Zig; tests at the bottom of each source file; shell integration tests in `tests/`.
- No tracked file names a box's own directories: packs are `${SUSHI_MODELS_DIR:-$HOME/.sushi/models}/<pack>`, run
  outputs `~/.sushi/runs/` (guard: `tests/test_no_local_paths.sh`).
- Env levers only for paths with two arms worth comparing (lossy/tradeoff), never for an obvious win/fix. A
  diagnostic env is read through `diagEnvOn` (absent or `0` = off), never `getenv != null`.
- **Diffs are read by a human. Keep them small.** A comment says what the code cannot (a non-obvious WHY, a contract,
  a unit) in one to three lines. Never bug history, measurements, review items, dates, PR numbers or a restatement of
  the code.
- **One story per gotcha, one line per rule**, in the matching doc. CHANGELOG: one user-facing sentence per change,
  no provisional numbers.
- Squash commits, one per PR. No Co-Authored-By attribution.

## Engine invariants (never break; the doc has the why)

- The inference thread is the SOLE mlx caller, even for frees ([engine-mlx-gotchas](docs/engine-mlx-gotchas.md)).
- The weight loader is ONE decision, `model.loadWeightsForConfig` ([server-lifecycle](docs/server-lifecycle.md)).
- An explicit launch flag outranks `model-settings.json`, which outranks the default
  ([server-lifecycle](docs/server-lifecycle.md#settings)).
- A bill follows the storage in the SAME commit; under-billing is a Metal OOM
  ([engine-memory-admission](docs/engine-memory-admission.md)).
- A stream and a non-stream answer are the SAME BYTES; emitted tool `arguments` are ALWAYS valid JSON
  ([server-http-apis](docs/server-http-apis.md), [server-tool-calling](docs/server-tool-calling.md)).
- A pack is judged by KLD against a lossless teacher, never by bytes against another pack
  ([quality-kld](docs/quality-kld.md)).

## Debugging

Server log `~/.sushi/logs/sushi-<port>.log` is THE post-mortem file (`--log-level debug`). Grep:
`jinja error:`, `[cache]`, `<- N+M tokens`, `tool_msgs=`, `[spec-stats]`, `[mtp-planner]`, `[mtp-trace]`,
`[loop-stop]`, `[admission]`, `[kv-cache]`, `[expert-stream]`, `[disk-cache]`, `[hot-cache]`, `[dtype-trace]`,
`[short-gen]`. Capture traffic: `SUSHI_RAW_DUMP_FILE=<abs>` → `tests/harvest_tool_traffic.py`. Reproduce tool bugs
`stream:false` first; between KV-poison tests stop your own server by PID, never `pkill`. `/props` reports
`active_bytes`, `memory.cache_bytes`, `batching`; RSS is blind to Metal.

## Team process

Procedures and examples: [docs/process-measurement.md](docs/process-measurement.md).

**GPU sharing.** The lock is for jobs that need the box to themselves: a full model load (server boot, KLD, live test)
and a quiet-box bench or timing whose absolute number is recorded. Conversions, pilots, builds and tests run in
parallel without it, as long as the total fits memory: never beside a MiMo-size (≥ 90 GB) load, and a quiet bench waits.
- Acquire the lock immediately before EACH run and release right after: `scripts/gpu-lock.sh acquire|release <owner>`;
  waiters are served FIFO by ticket, `status` shows holder + queue (`${GPU_LOCK_DIR:-/tmp/sushi-gpu.lock.d}`).
- Never hold it across a batch or queue, or while analysing, editing, building or waiting. An A B B A re-acquires per
  arm. Every brief that runs on the GPU names the lock.
- A holder that looks dead (its run gone, lock still held): a worker never breaks it; it tells the coordinator, who
  verifies the run is gone, clears it with `gpu-lock.sh break <holder>`, and the queue proceeds.

**Baselines.**
- Never rerun an old-binary/old-code baseline that is already recorded: run only the new arm and compare it with the
  recorded number. Within a session, inherit the previous number.
- Run an old-binary baseline only in a clean new session (or when none exists for that exact setting; say which).
- Existing pack shards are a converter's byte-identity baseline.
- Committed docs cite commit + settings beside every new number; raw-file paths go to `docs/private/measurement-raw.md`.

**Landing perf.** A speedup that is real (outside run-to-run noise, arms interleaved in one session) and leaves output
bit-identical lands whatever its size. A change that alters output lands only through the KLD gate
([quality-kld](docs/quality-kld.md)). Judge a tweak on top of the change it builds on, not alone against the old code.

**Measurement hygiene.**
- Rebuild ReleaseFast from the head under test right before any live number; stamp commit + binary mtime beside it.
- Restore QoS for agent-launched timed jobs (`taskpolicy -a`); state the QoS, lock and baseline beside every number.
- Bench thermal protocol: under heavy GPU workload AND with a die sensor over 90 °C, fans to max and 3 min idle before
  the bench starts; otherwise fans to max and a 10 s wait. Fans back to auto when the bench ends. Nothing else runs meanwhile.
  Under it one A then one B suffices; A B B A only when the expected difference is within a few percent.
- Never wait on `pgrep -f <string>` (the waiting shell matches itself): wait on END markers, PIDs, or `pgrep -x`.
- Launch flags outrank `model-settings.json`; confirm the load lines (`[kv-cache]`, `[mtp]`) show the intended arm.
- KLD is 16 prompts x 512 tokens scored to the first EOS, for every model; the teacher carries no lossy step of its own.

**Coordinator.**
- Reports partial work to the owner every :00 and :30 while work runs.
- Relays owner decisions and rule changes to ALL live workers at once.
- Keeps docs/ fresh: every landing updates the matching doc (knowledge, numbers, lessons learned) in the same
  landing, and this index when a doc appears. CLAUDE.md stays rules + index, never the knowledge store.

**Workers.**
- Report progress and blockers to the coordinator; commit per step; don't push or merge unless told.
- State the QoS, lock and baseline used beside every number; put new knowledge in the matching doc in the branch.

**Growth policy (ENFORCED).** This file holds rules and links only and stays well under 20 KB; every rule bullet is
≤ 3 lines. Knowledge, measurements and war stories go to `docs/` (converter knowledge to `docs/private/`); commit
messages carry the story of a change.

## Licensing

Ported kernels + vendored code are enumerated in `NOTICE` (the ONE place); `LICENSE`/`LICENSE-APACHE-2.0`/`NOTICE`
ride every packaging path (`tests/test_release_workflow_gates.sh`). To enumerate ports, grep comments for
`mlxfast|oMLX|MTPLX|mlx-lm|port`.
