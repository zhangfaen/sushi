# Engine: QSA sparse attention and long context (qwen4_exp)

How Qwen3.8-Flash-Next attends past 2048 tokens: the QSA indexer, block selection, the gather/split-K arms per query
width, the indexer history, and the long-context admission and load-time bills. Every mechanism here is gated by ONE
predicate, `ModelConfig.longCtxGated()`. Read this before touching any `qsa*` function in `src/transformer.zig`.

## Attention arms by query width

- **QSA GATHERS selected blocks, never a dense `[S, kv]` mask** on a packed cache.
- Selection = the exact radix-select `sushi_qsa_select` on both arms, SPLIT across 16 threadgroups at decode widths
  (`SUSHI_QSA_SELECT_SPLIT=0`).
- Rows 1..15 (decode and verify) = the fused split-K `qsaSparseAttn` on dense and packed caches alike
  (`qsaAlignedSparseAttn`; `SUSHI_QSA_ATTN_MIN_S` raises its floor). When it declines, decode falls to
  `qsaDecodeGatherAttn` and rows 2..15 to the union gather `qsaVerifyGatherAttn`
  (`SUSHI_QSA_ATTN_KERNEL=0` forces the union gather).
- **A PACKED (kv8/kv4) cache never takes the dense-mask arm and never rebuilds whole per layer**
  (`qsaSparseAttnServes`): split-K serves up to `QSA_ATTN_PACKED_MAX_S` = 40 rows; past that
  `gatherQsa256Packed` gathers the packed rows in place while each cache row is staged at most
  `QSA_PACKED_GATHER_MAX_REUSE` = 4 times (`qsaPackedGatherServes`), else a gather over ONE rebuild.
  `kvDequantScratchBytes` bills the rebuild per forward width (`qsaDenseRebuildRows`); `SUSHI_QSA_ATTN_KERNEL=0`
  restores the old route and its bill.
- Prefill = `gatherQsa256`; batched slots keep the dense mask up to the gather floor: (top-512 + 1) x 4 = 2052 keys
  where the NAX gather serves (`qsaPrefillGatherMinKv`), 8192 elsewhere; decode and verify floors are unchanged.
- **Verify gather kv floor is per KV SCHEME** (`qsaVerifyGatherMinKvFor`: dense 32768, quantized 16384).

## Batched image and text streams

M-RoPE slots use the same batched QSA gather as text slots. Queries are rotated before attention, cached keys
already carry their positions, and batched RoPE offsets include each slot's M-RoPE delta. Keeping an image slot's
selected blocks avoids forcing the whole group onto a dense mask over the full KV cache. The scheduler bills
pad waste using the selected length whenever the gather for that query width is enabled; its existing switches
and KV floors still apply.

Ported from [mlx-serve #668](https://github.com/ddalcu/mlx-serve/pull/668). The regression test compares the same
batched attention inputs with and without M-RoPE metadata and requires identical output. The scheduler test
checks that a 300k/1k pair remains grouped under sparse billing. This does not change MTP-head batching's
separate M-RoPE guard.

## Selection semantics

- **The always-visible tail is PER QUERY** (tokens at/after `ratio·floor((p+1)/ratio)`), scores in f32 like the
  reference, `torch.topk` keeps the LOWER block index on exact-zero ties.
- QSA caps attended keys at top-512 blocks x 4 = 2048 per query: decode attention reads ~25 MB/token at kv8, under
  1% of the weights, which is why generic kv8 attention kernels never engage on this arch.

## Indexer

- The score sheet is ONE NAX kernel (`sushi_qsa_score`, bit-identical to the stock tf32 chain;
  `SUSHI_QSA_SCORE_FUSED=0`).
- The prefill gather rides NAX cooperative tensors on its own predicate (`qsaNaxEligible`: G17 + macOS 26.3 + bf16 +
  hd 256 + gqa 12 + q_len ≥ 16; bar = per-element error vs float64 no worse than stock,
  `tests/qsa_nax_precision.py`, never bytes). The packed NAX variant joins the NAX probe.
- The dense NAX gather is oMLX's occupancy-tuned kernel (mlx-serve #636): one (query, KV head) per threadgroup, the
  12 grouped heads as rows of a 16-row tile, no K/V staging, P as fp16 hi+lo; packed kv4/kv8 gathers keep the old
  kernel. `SUSHI_PROFILE_ATTN=1` logs synced indexer / projection / QSA / tail laps once per forward (`[qwen4-attn]`).
- One effective YaRN mscale on every indexer arm; the indexer ropes with the SAME M-RoPE table as attention.
- The pooled block keys are ONE kernel (`sushi_qsa_pool_rope`, from mlx-serve #556): block mean, key norm and
  partial RoPE, bit-identical to the MLX chain. It serves text turns, bf16, 128-wide keys and ratios up to 8; M-RoPE
  turns and other shapes keep the chain. No env lever; `SUSHI_DECODE_FWD_UBENCH_QSA_POOL_ARMS=1` is its A/B
  ([perf-baselines](perf-baselines.md#qsa-pool-rope)).

## Indexer history

- ONE copy per (slot ∪ entry); the newest snap VIEWS the live buffer at commit (`handoffQsaHistoryToLatest`); none
  after restore = MISS; the f32 score bank is billed; raw keys are a 32-row ring billed once per slot
  (`qsaRingBytes`).
- Per-request state outside conv/ssm rides `SSMCacheEntry.aux_state` + `ple_prev`, freed only through
  `ssmFreeQsaState`. Never hand a null `mlx_array` to the spec tensor-map insert (a pooled-only head arrives with
  `aux_state.ctx == null`).
- A cache keyed on a POINTER is invalidated by an ATOMIC MARK (`markQsaPooledRopeStale`), never an off-thread free.

## Admission and load-time bills

- Past 32k a request RESERVES its KV capacity up front (`KVCache.reservedTokens`; `SUSHI_KV_RESERVE=0`).
- A long prefill EVICTS the hot cache to be admitted on the INFERENCE thread (`evictLruToAdmit`, credits only
  PROVABLY reclaimable bytes, refuses by NAME `PrefillDoesNotFit` → 400, defers a warm prompt to the `WarmPrefix`
  bill); ONE `[admission]` line.
- The prefill width is per-REQUEST and re-chosen per CHUNK (`chooseRequestPrefillChunk`, `adaptivePrefillWidth`).
- **Load-time bills** run INSIDE `Scheduler.init`: KV width from `configuredKvQuantFor(config)`, context from
  `resolvedContextForLoad` with the CONSTANT `CTX_SIZING_CACHE_RESERVE`, the hot-cache clamp reserves the ladder
  FLOOR. A KV bill is per CACHING LAYER (`kvBytesPerToken` via `attnCacheLayerCount`); `prefillStreamBytesPerToken`
  adds the arch's own streams (GDN chunk-wide q/k/v, MoE `top_k` replication); the chunk-independent part is a
  RUNTIME floor.
