//! Plan 03 — hot prefix cache (Phase 1).
//!
//! Replaces the legacy single-slot `cached_prompt_ids` with a small bounded
//! LRU keyed by `(prompt_ids ++ generated_ids, has_tools)`. Each entry owns a
//! `KVCacheSnapshot` of the live cache at the moment the request finished —
//! refcount-shared handles point at the GPU buffers that filled positions
//! 0..len. On a new request we longest-prefix match across entries, restore
//! the best one back into `xfm.cache`, and let the existing
//! truncate-then-prefill path handle the diverged tail.
//!
//! Hybrid SSM/conv architectures (qwen3_5/qwen3_5_moe/qwen3_next/nemotron_h/
//! lfm2) are excluded in v1: their recurrent state can't be rolled back, so
//! prefix reuse must reset on any divergence anyway. Plan 03's spec calls
//! these "hot tier only" — meaning we keep the single-slot path for them.
//! `HotPrefixCache.shouldUse(config)` returns false for those archs.
